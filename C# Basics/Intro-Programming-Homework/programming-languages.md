**Java**
Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It is a concurrent, class-based, object-oriented programming language. Java applications are compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java Vertual Mashine (JVM). It is similar to CSharp's MSIL code that run on CLR.

**C**
C was designed by Dennis Ritchie. C is an imperative, procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support.

**C++**
C++ was designed by Bjarne Stroustrup. C++ has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms and provided by various organizations. C++ has also been found useful for desktop applications, servers and performance-critical applications . Many other programming languages have been influenced by C++, including C#, Java, and newer versions of C.

**JavaScript**
JavaScript (JS) was designed by Brendan Eich. JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, **untyped**, and interpreted scripting programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential technologies of WWW content production. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. The syntax of JavaScript is derived from C.

**PHP**
PHP was designed by Rasmus Lerdorf. PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.
